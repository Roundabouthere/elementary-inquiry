# Code Club

> About Code Club
> Our aim is to inspire the next generation to get excited about computer science and digital making.
> Our projects are easy to follow step-by-step guides which help children learn Scratch, HTML & CSS and Python by making games, animations, and websites. The projects gradually introduce coding concepts to allow children to build their knowledge incrementally, meaning thereâ€™s also no need for the adult running the session to be a computing expert.
